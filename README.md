# The Games Collector

I wanted a unified way to launch my games, instead of having to use different interfaces to launch them and having to manually handle screens, resolutions and input mapping.

# Installation
_Under construction_

# Configuration
A script is located in the _bin_ directory of the installation that can be used to configure The Games Collector. How the script works is shown [here](Configure.md)
